This repository demonstrates a scenario where a TypeScript type error is not caught by the compiler during development.  The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers, however, a string is passed as an argument, leading to a runtime error. This highlights a potential issue when the compiler fails to detect type mismatches. The solution demonstrates how to improve type checking to avoid this.
